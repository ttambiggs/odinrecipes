  <h2> <strong> Description </strong> </h2>
  <p>If there is one easy, quick weeknight meal I regularly make, its noodles.<br> 
    And creamy peanut sauce is one of my all time favs.</p>
  <p>  
    Its funny, because I used to hate peanut butter (and most nuts in general)<br> 
    and now I dont know how I could live without them. </p> 
  <p>
    The peanut butter and coconut cream make for the most velvety, sweet and <br> 
    totally addictive satay sauce. I am almost certain you will be going in for seconds, and thirds.</p>

  <h2> <strong> Ingredients </strong></h2>
    <h3> Peanut Sauce </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Red Onion</li>
        <li>1 tsp Light Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Smooth Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>1 tin Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dried Chilli Flakes</li>
        <li>1 tsp Ground Ginger</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    <h3> Everything Else </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Carrots</li>
        <li>1 Red Pepper</li>
        <li>125g Chestnut Mushrooms</li>
        <li>140g Wholewheat Noodles</li>
      </ul>

  <h2> <strong> Steps </strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Thinly slice the onion and fry in vegetable/coconut oil on medium heat. Once translucent, <br>
        add the sugar and turn down the heat. Stir and cook until sticky and caramalised.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Add the peanut butter, soy sauce, maple syrup, ginger and chilli.<br>
        You can omit the chilli or add less if you don't want the spice.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Stir and then add the cream from the tin of the coconut milk a tbsp at a time. Turn back <br>
        up the heat so it is gently simmering. You will end up using all of the cream from the <br>
        coconut milk, add a little of the water if you want a thinner consistency.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Meanwhile, fry the vegetables in a separate pan. Start with the carrots, then add the <br>
        peppers and lastly the mushrooms. If you are adding tofu or seitan you may want to fry <br>
        in a separate pan and then add to the vegetables.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Boil some water in a saucepan and add the noodles. Cook according to packet instructions. <br>
        I use wholewheat noodles that take 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Once cooked, drain and put the noodles back in the saucepan. Add the satay sauce and stir <br>
        until all the noodles are coated. Lastly, add the veg and stir.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Serve and top with extra chilly, soy sauce, and chopped scallions.</li>
    </ol>
