  <h2> <strong> Description </strong> </h2>
  <p>From one cheese lover to another, I’m here to tell you that<br>

  <p>Vegans, dairy-free friends, and cheese lovers who crave a more <br>
     redeeming mac and cheese recipe, this recipe is for you.  </p> 
  
  <h2> <strong> Ingredients </strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>8 oz Macaroni Elbows</li>
        <li>1 Broccoli</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons Avocado Oil</li>
        <li>1 Small Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 Cup Peeled Potato</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Onion Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Dry Mustard Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Fine Sea Salt</li>
        <li>Pinch of Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Raw Cashews</li>
        <li>1/4 Nutritional Yeast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
      </ul>
        <br>

  <h2> <strong> Steps </strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Cook according<br>
          to package directions. If using broccoli, stir it into the pot when just <br>
          2 to 3 more minutes remain. Drain, and transfer the contents to a large serving bowl.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Meanwhile, in a medium-to-large saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. <br>
          Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until the <br>
          onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Add the grated potato, garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, <br>
          salt and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine, and cook, stirring constantly, <br>
          for about 1 minute to enhance their flavors.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Add the cashews and water, and stir to combine. Let the mixture come to a <br>
          simmer. Continue simmering, stirring frequently and reducing heat as necessary <br>
          to avoid a rapid boil, until the potatoes are completely tender and cooked through, <br>
          about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Carefully pour the mixture into a blender. Add the nutritional yeast and 2 teaspoons<br>
          vinegar. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping to <br>
          scrape down the sides if necessary. If the mixture won’t blend easily or if you would <br>
          prefer a thinner consistency, add water in ¼ cup increments, blending after each one.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Taste, and blend in additional salt until the sauce is utterly irresistible <br>
          (I typically add at least another ½ teaspoon). If it needs a little more zip, add the <br>
          remaining teaspoon of vinegar. Blend again.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Pour the sauce into the bowl of pasta. Stir until well combined, and serve immediately. <br>
          Leftovers keep well, chilled and covered, for 3 to 4 days. Gentle reheat, adding a tiny<br>
          splash of water if necessary to loosen up the sauce.</li>
      
    </ol>
